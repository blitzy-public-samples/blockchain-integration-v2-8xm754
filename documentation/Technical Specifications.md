# SYSTEM DESIGN

## PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES

The Blockchain Integration Service and Dashboard will utilize the following programming languages:

| Language | Purpose | Justification |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| Go (Golang) | Backend services | High performance, excellent concurrency support, strong typing, and efficient memory management. Ideal for building scalable microservices. |
| JavaScript (ES6+) | Frontend development | Widely supported, rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks (React.js), and enables dynamic, interactive user interfaces. |
| SQL | Database queries | Standard language for relational database interactions, used with PostgreSQL. |
| Solidity | Smart contract development (if needed) | Primary language for Ethereum smart contract development, may be needed for future blockchain integrations. |

## DATABASE DESIGN

The system will use PostgreSQL as the primary relational database. The database schema will be designed to support the core entities and their relationships:

```mermaid
erDiagram
    Organization ||--o{ Vault : owns
    Vault ||--o{ Transaction : contains
    Vault ||--o{ SignatureRequest : has
    Transaction ||--o{ SignatureRequest : requires
    Organization {
        uuid id PK
        string name
        string api_key
        timestamp created_at
        timestamp updated_at
    }
    Vault {
        uuid id PK
        uuid organization_id FK
        string blockchain_type
        string address
        decimal balance
        timestamp created_at
        timestamp updated_at
    }
    Transaction {
        uuid id PK
        uuid vault_id FK
        string status
        decimal amount
        string recipient_address
        string tx_hash
        timestamp created_at
        timestamp updated_at
    }
    SignatureRequest {
        uuid id PK
        uuid vault_id FK
        uuid transaction_id FK
        string status
        text raw_signature
        timestamp created_at
        timestamp updated_at
    }
```

Additional considerations:
- Implement appropriate indexes on frequently queried columns.
- Use UUID for primary keys to ensure uniqueness across distributed systems.
- Implement database partitioning for `Transaction` and `SignatureRequest` tables to improve query performance on large datasets.

## API DESIGN

The system will expose a RESTful API for communication between the frontend and backend, as well as for potential integration with external systems. The API will be designed following OpenAPI (Swagger) specifications.

Key API endpoints:

1. Vault Management
```
GET    /api/v1/vaults
POST   /api/v1/vaults
GET    /api/v1/vaults/{id}
PUT    /api/v1/vaults/{id}
DELETE /api/v1/vaults/{id}
```

2. Signature Requests
```
POST   /api/v1/signature-requests
GET    /api/v1/signature-requests/{id}
GET    /api/v1/signature-requests/{id}/status
```

3. Transactions
```
POST   /api/v1/transactions
GET    /api/v1/transactions/{id}
GET    /api/v1/transactions/{id}/status
```

4. Analytics
```
GET    /api/v1/analytics/vault-performance
GET    /api/v1/analytics/transaction-volume
```

API Design Principles:
- Use versioning (e.g., `/api/v1/`) to allow for future updates without breaking existing integrations.
- Implement proper error handling with standardized error responses.
- Use JWT for authentication and implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.
- Follow RESTful naming conventions and use appropriate HTTP methods.

## USER INTERFACE DESIGN

The frontend dashboard will be developed using React.js with Material-UI components for a consistent and modern look. The user interface will be designed with a focus on usability and real-time data presentation.

Key components of the user interface:

1. Dashboard Overview
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Dashboard] --> B[Vault Summary]
    A --> C[Recent Transactions]
    A --> D[Performance Metrics]
    A --> E[Alerts and Notifications]
```

2. Vault Management Interface

    A[Vault Management] --> B[Vault List]
    A --> C[Vault Details]
    B --> D[Filter and Sort]
    C --> E[Transaction History]
    C --> F[Balance Chart]
    C --> G[Signature Request Form]
```

3. Transaction Monitoring
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Transaction Monitoring] --> B[Real-time Status Updates]
    A --> C[Transaction List]
    C --> D[Filter and Search]
    C --> E[Transaction Details]
    E --> F[Blockchain Explorer Link]
```

4. Analytics and Reporting
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Analytics] --> B[Performance Charts]
    A --> C[Transaction Volume]
    A --> D[Custom Report Generator]
    B --> E[Date Range Selector]
    C --> F[Network Distribution]
```

UI Design Principles:
- Implement a responsive design that works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Use a consistent color scheme and typography throughout the application.
- Provide clear navigation and intuitive user flows.
- Implement real-time updates using WebSocket connections for live data.
- Design with accessibility in mind, following WCAG 2.1 guidelines.

The user interface will be designed to provide a seamless and efficient experience for managing blockchain operations, monitoring transactions, and analyzing performance metrics. The use of React.js and Material-UI will ensure a modern, responsive, and consistent look and feel across the application.
