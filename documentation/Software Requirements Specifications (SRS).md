## COMMUNICATION INTERFACES

The Blockchain Integration Service and Dashboard will utilize various communication protocols to ensure efficient and secure data exchange:

1. HTTPS:
   - Purpose: Secure communication for all web-based interactions
   - Port: 443
   - Data Format: Encrypted HTTP traffic

2. WebSocket:
   - Purpose: Real-time updates for the frontend dashboard
   - Port: 443 (WSS)
   - Data Format: JSON messages over encrypted WebSocket connection

3. gRPC:
   - Purpose: High-performance communication between microservices (if applicable)
   - Port: Configurable (typically 50051)
   - Data Format: Protocol Buffers

4. TLS:
   - Purpose: Encryption layer for all network communications
   - Version: TLS 1.3 or higher

5. DNS:
   - Purpose: Domain name resolution for service discovery
   - Port: 53

6. NTP:
   - Purpose: Time synchronization for accurate transaction timestamps
   - Port: 123

Data Formats:
- JSON: Used for most API responses and requests
- Protocol Buffers: Used for efficient serialization in gRPC communications
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens): Used for authentication and authorization

Interaction Methods:
- RESTful API calls for most service-to-service communications
- WebSocket connections for real-time updates to the frontend
- Publish/Subscribe model using Kafka for event-driven architecture
- Database queries using prepared statements to prevent SQL injection

All communication interfaces will implement appropriate security measures, including encryption, authentication, and rate limiting to prevent abuse and ensure data integrity.
