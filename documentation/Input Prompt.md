We are building a Blockchain Integration Service and Dashboard for a startup in the cryptocurrency space. The service needs to integrate with Utxo custodian and support XRP and Ethereum blockchains. The system consists of a backend service and a frontend dashboard. The backend service, written in Golang, needs to provide the following API endpoints: 1) Get All Vaults - retrieve a list of vaults associated with an organization ID. 2) Get Raw Signature - obtain a raw signature from the custodian given the necessary credentials. 3) Check Signature Status - poll for the status of a signature generation process. 4) Publish Signature - automatically publish completed signatures to a Kafka stream or other event streaming service. The service should implement asynchronous processing for signature requests, updating a local Redis database when signatures are ready. Security is paramount, so AWS Secrets Manager should be used for storing sensitive credentials. The system must be highly scalable, resilient, and implement comprehensive error handling and logging. The frontend dashboard should display a list of all vaults, allow users to request signatures for specific vaults, show signature request status in real-time, and provide analytics and monitoring features. It should be a modern, responsive web application. The entire system must be designed with a focus on security, minimizing the use of external libraries to reduce potential vulnerabilities. All communications must be encrypted and authenticated. Comprehensive API documentation, including Swagger docs, is required. The system should be designed for high performance, low latency, and the ability to handle a large number of concurrent requests. It must be horizontally scalable and implement fault-tolerance mechanisms. Compliance with relevant financial and blockchain regulations is crucial, including the implementation of necessary audit trails. Future considerations include support for additional custodians and blockchain networks, enhanced analytics, integration with other microservices, and an automated backup and recovery system for user wallets. This solution will be critical for the startup's operations, enabling them to onboard new clients quickly and securely manage blockchain transactions.
