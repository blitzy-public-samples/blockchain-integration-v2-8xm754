# Human tasks:
# - Review and update the list of ignored files and directories as the project evolves
# - Consider adding patterns for language-specific temporary or build files
# - Ensure that no sensitive information (like API keys or credentials) is accidentally tracked
# - Add patterns for local configuration files that shouldn't be shared
# - Consider adding patterns for log files if not already covered
# - Review and possibly include the vendor directory if dependency vendoring is used
# - Add patterns for any additional IDE or text editor specific files
# - Consider adding patterns for any temporary files created by your build or test processes
# - Ensure that large binary files or datasets are properly ignored
# - Regularly clean up and remove any obsolete patterns
